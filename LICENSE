GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it is free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software and share your changes with others, and that you are treated fairly should you distribute copies of software.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.  You must share your source code with the recipients as well.  And you must keep that license intact so that everyone else also has these freedoms.

Those who wish to distribute software in a different way—in ways that deny others these freedoms—must not use this license.  If your program is a subroutine library, you might consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, the GNU Lesser General Public License gives you that permission.

1. GENERAL TERMS

  1.1. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the authors saying it can be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  1.2. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is deemed to be your own.

  1.3. You may make, run and propagate closed source versions of the Program, provided that you do not distribute them; that is, you may not give the program to others or make it available to them in any form.

  1.4. This License does not grant you any rights to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Free Software Foundation, except as required to reproduce the notices in the Program.

  1.5. You may not impose any further restrictions on the rights granted by this License.  You are not allowed to add other conditions to those of this License.

2. COPYING

  2.1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and that you distribute a copy of this License along with the Program.

  2.2. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

  2.3. You may not impose any further restrictions on the rights granted by this License.  You are not allowed to add other conditions to those of this License.

3. MODIFICATION

  3.1. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 2 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice along with this license, as well as a warning that users may not copy, modify, or distribute the program except as expressly provided under this License.

4. DISTRIBUTION

  4.1. You may distribute copies of the Program in any medium, provided that you meet the following conditions:

    a) You must cause the distributed Program to carry a prominent notice stating that you have changed the Program.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

5. ACCEPTING THE LICENSE

  5.1. You accept this License if you distribute the Program in any way or if you modify it in any way.  You will also be deemed to accept this License if you possess a copy of the Program.  If the Program is not the original version, you must also pass on to the recipients all notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; you must also pass on copies of this License along with any copies you distribute.

6. TERMINATION

  6.1. You may not distribute the Program if you do not accept this License, or if you fail to comply with any of its terms.

  6.2. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon failure to comply with its terms.  You do not need to receive notice from anyone in order for the termination to take effect.  However, if you have distributed copies of the Program, you are not responsible for any failure to comply with the License's terms if you can show that you were not aware of the failure.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

  7.1. The Program is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.  In no event shall the Free Software Foundation be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the Program or the use or other dealings in the Program.

8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

  8.1. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Free Software Foundation, or any other party who modifies and/or redistributes the Program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use of the Program (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the Program to operate with any other programs), even if such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 

9. INTERPRETATION

  9.1. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be enforced to the fullest extent permissible, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

10. FUTURE VERSIONS

  10.1. The Free Software Foundation may publish new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  10.2. Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.

  10.3. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version of the License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

11. RELICENSING

  11.1. If the Program is licensed under this version of the License, you may, at your option, relicense it under any later version of the License published by the Free Software Foundation.  You may also relicense it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License, which permits linking proprietary applications with the library.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software that everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  A good place to put this information is in the source code files.  You can also include it in the documentation.

  "<program> is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version."

  "<program> is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details."

  "You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with <program>.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>."
